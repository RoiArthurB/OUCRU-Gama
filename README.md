## Background

### OUCRU

The Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU) in Hanoi is a small research group split across two sites â€“ The National Hospital for Tropical Diseases (NHTD), and the National Institute for Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE). The group is involved with a range of research activities, mainly related to infectious diseases, with a particular focus on antibiotic resistance, vaccine-preventable diseases and influenza. It is also largely involved in translating research results into actionable policies, together with the Ministry of Health.

## Description

Our group is involved in a lot of population-based research around antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance. Levels of antibiotic use in Vietnam are very high, leading to the emergence and spread of bacterial strains that are resistant to antibiotic therapy.

_Streptococcus pneumoniae_ is a bacteria that is commonly found inside the nose and throat, and usually does no harm. When this bacteria gets into the wrong places it can cause a clinical infection, such as pneumonia. If the strain of bacteria responsible for this infection is resistant to antibiotic therapy, the infection can become very difficult to treat. 

### Agent-Based Modeling 

We would like to develop an agent-based model to explore the emergence and transmission of resistant strains of _S. pneumoniae_ in the community, and how this is related to current patterns of antibiotic use. Further, we would like to explore the potential effect of introducing public health interventions that may target the emergence of resistant strains (e.g. behavior-change interventions targeting unnecessary antibiotic use), or the transmission of resistant strains (e.g. vaccination, hand hygiene). 

To do so, we will use the _[GAMA Platform](https://gama-platform.github.io/)_. _GAMA_ (_GIS Agent-based Modeling Architecture_) is an open-source software which has been developed with a very general approach, and can be used for many applications domains. _GAML_ is the language used in GAMA, coded in Java. It is an agent-based language, that provides you the possibility to build your model with several paradigms of modeling. It is developed by several teams under the umbrella of the IRD/UPMC international research unit [UMMISCO](http://www.ummisco.ird.fr/).
